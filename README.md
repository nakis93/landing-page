# landing-page
This is the first CSS-HTML project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).
The idea is to try and replicate a landing page based on some blueprints (instructions here https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
Special thanks to https://www.pexels.com/ for the free images!
